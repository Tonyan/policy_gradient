{"name":"Policy Gradient","tagline":"","body":"### Summary\r\nPython implementation of policy gradient reinforcement learning methods, built on TensorFlow. Flexible reinforcement learning framework that does not require dynamics of the environment. Given a sequence of state-action pairs and rewards, adjusts policy based on gradient steps with respect to its parameters. \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n    pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi policy_gradient\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n    learner = PolicyGradient(net_dims=net_dims, output_function='tanh')\r\n    learner.train_agent(dynamics_func, reward_func, initial_state)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n#### User","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
